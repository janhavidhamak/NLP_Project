Review
"I use pretty strong facewash so my face can get a bit dry and show signs of such. This is a quality product that hydrates your skin and doesn't smell bad at all-quite neutral and pleasant. A tiny bit goes a long way, so I will have this moisturizer for a long time and it last the test of time, likely through many bottles of face wash. It might be a little pricier, but I find it to be pointless to use a face wash that works, to then use a product that would cause your skin to be oily again. Therefore, I find this lotion to be a good investment considering how it works well and will last me a long time."
I use this every night. It moisturizes great for my sensitive skin
Really easy to apply. Smooth and absorbs quickly
will always be buying this it’s light weight and not greasy
"This is a very nice and hydrating moisturizer, however for it being a product you use at night I expected it to be heavier and thicker. This has more of a thin consistency, however it works wonderfully and is a great lightweight night moisturizer. It does not have any smell to it and does have a good amount of product for the cost. I would recommend if you are looking for something hydrating with a lighter feel. I have oily and acne prone skin and it has not broken me out and I have been using it for 2 weeks. Overall a great beginner face moisturizer."
"I am turning 41 and have noticed my skin becoming more dry and wrinkly. Did some research and decided to choose this product based on my budget. Only has been 3 days since I started using and my skin has made improvements. I still have my fine wrinkles but product is not designed to treat wrinkles but it did moisturize my face like no product has ever done before and I normally have an extremely dry face. I am seeing less fine wrinkles bc my face is more hydrated. The product makes my skin extremely smooth. I use it every night as soon as I take off my makeup for the day. Very impressed with the quality and product and IMO money well spent especially on a budget! I also ended up purchasing the day moisturizer with built in sunscreen to use pre shower and makeup and that has also been amazing for my skin! Great products overall!!!! I recommend buying both for optimal results, you won’t be disappointed."
"Great for nighttime use. It's on the thin side and is non-greasy. The pump dispenser is great, and can be locked for travel."
This is perfect for me to use after using my Retin-A at night. It has the ingredient of hylauronic acid that my dermatologist told me to use with Retin-A. It is not too thick and seems to be very moisturizing and that’s good especially when you use Retin-A. I’m very happy with this moisturizer and the cost was definitely fair.
This is my go to love this stuff. Very gental on the skin
"Light moisturizer, better for daytime"

will always be buying this it’s light weight and not greasy
"This is a very nice and hydrating moisturizer, however for it being a product you use at night I expected it to be heavier and thicker. This has more of a thin consistency, however it works wonderfully and is a great lightweight night moisturizer. It does not have any smell to it and does have a good amount of product for the cost. I would recommend if you are looking for something hydrating with a lighter feel. I have oily and acne prone skin and it has not broken me out and I have been using it for 2 weeks. Overall a great beginner face moisturizer."
"I am turning 41 and have noticed my skin becoming more dry and wrinkly. Did some research and decided to choose this product based on my budget. Only has been 3 days since I started using and my skin has made improvements. I still have my fine wrinkles but product is not designed to treat wrinkles but it did moisturize my face like no product has ever done before and I normally have an extremely dry face. I am seeing less fine wrinkles bc my face is more hydrated. The product makes my skin extremely smooth. I use it every night as soon as I take off my makeup for the day. Very impressed with the quality and product and IMO money well spent especially on a budget! I also ended up purchasing the day moisturizer with built in sunscreen to use pre shower and makeup and that has also been amazing for my skin! Great products overall!!!! I recommend buying both for optimal results, you won’t be disappointed."
"Great for nighttime use. It's on the thin side and is non-greasy. The pump dispenser is great, and can be locked for travel."
This is perfect for me to use after using my Retin-A at night. It has the ingredient of hylauronic acid that my dermatologist told me to use with Retin-A. It is not too thick and seems to be very moisturizing and that’s good especially when you use Retin-A. I’m very happy with this moisturizer and the cost was definitely fair.
This is my go to love this stuff. Very gental on the skin
