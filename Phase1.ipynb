Did some research and decided to choose this product based on my budget. Only has been 3 days since I started using and my skin has made improvements. I still have my fine wrinkles but product is not designed to treat wrinkles but it did moisturize my face like no product has ever done before and I normally have an extremely dry face. I am seeing less fine wrinkles bc my face is more hydrated. The product makes my skin extremely smooth. I use it every night as soon as I take off my makeup for the day. Very impressed with the quality and product and IMO money well spent especially on a budget! I also ended up purchasing the day moisturizer with built in sunscreen to use pre shower and makeup and that has also been amazing for my skin! Great products overall!!!! I recommend buying both for optimal results, you won\\u2019t be disappointed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"en\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"translated_review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"This is my go to love this stuff.
